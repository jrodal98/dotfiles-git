This repo contains most of my configuration files for my Arch Linux + i3Gaps ThinkPad T470s laptop.  Currently, my configuration for the following software is in the repo:

1) i3-gaps
2) polybar
3) ranger
4) zsh
5) st terminal
6) nvim
7) dunst

and probably other things.

- A list of all of my pacman packages is in [packages.txt](packages.txt)
- A (mostly) complete list of my fonts is provided in a text file as well.
